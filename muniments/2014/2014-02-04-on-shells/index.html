My argument to others to use your shell more is simply that you <strong>see</strong> what is happening with your computer a lot easier than you can with a graphical user interface (GUI). Basically, your shell is somewhat like a glass bottom boat to see what your computer is actually doing. On linux, GUI's often have an option to pull up some of what your computer is doing, but for the most part they do not.</p><p>The other major argument for using your shell is that once you have it set up it is fast. Damn fast. I can do so much so quickly with my shell that takes me a lot longer with a GUI. This means that I spend last time on both billable and non-billable tasks &ndash; leaving more time to do other things.</p><h2 id=setting-up-a-drop-down-terminal-in-ubuntu>Setting up a Drop Down Terminal in Ubuntu</h2><p>Every POSIX system has a shell terminal application which you can use. But the first time you open it, it usually looks super scary &ndash; as in DOS scary. The best news is that once you get over that initial shock (perhaps by following this small tutorial) it can be a very pleasant experience. In Ubuntu you can get to your shell by typing <code>ctrl+alt+t</code> (for terminal). I don't like the main Gnome terminal application not because it is bad, indeed it is perfectly fine. I just prefer <a href=https://github.com/Guake/guake>Guake</a> because it is a terminal which stays hidden at the &ldquo;top&rdquo; of my screen completely out of sight. I start Guake on login, so it is <em>always</em> available. All I have to do is to press <code>F12</code> and I'm instantly in a terminal which drops down over my open program. I set Guake to take up about 45% of my screen real estate which allows me to see the rest of whatever application I need. There is a newer terminal application, <a href=https://github.com/ozcanesen/terra-terminal>Terra Terminal</a>, which performs similarly in some respects but adds additional features, such as terminal splitting which I never used. Terra is still in development so after using it for a while I switched back to Guake which is more stable.</p><p>Installing Guake could not be more simple. Drop into a terminal and type:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>$ sudo apt-get install guake
</code></pre></div><p>Once the installation finishes, Guake will be in your applications. The next thing you will want to do is to add Guake to your startup applications. Open your applications and search for startup. When the GUI opens, click &ldquo;Add&rdquo; then in the &ldquo;Name&rdquo; field type Guake and in the &ldquo;Command&rdquo; field type <code>guake</code>. That's it. Next time you login Guake is ready for you. If you want to start guake without logging out and back in, go to your applications and search for guake and start guake terminal. Now you have your initial setup.</p><p>Guake and Gnome Terminal (what you get when you type <code>ctrl+alt+t</code>) both are simply terminals. They are like a portal to your shell program. Your shell program is distinct from you terminal program. You can use a terminal to run almost any shell program that you like. Shell programs live &ldquo;below&rdquo; your terminal in the stack between your eyeballs and your computer's processor. So with the same terminal, you can use different shells.</p><h2 id=shell-programs>Shell Programs</h2><p>Ubuntu's default shell (and indeed many the default shell for many POSIX systems) is <code>bash</code>. Bash is a good shell. Personally, I do not use it. I use <code>zsh</code> mainly because its community has a ton of plugins and installation scripts which I have used to automate the installation of my luxurious shell setup. There is a long history of (ahem) discourse between the supporters of the two shells and you can google to find it. Of course, POSIX being POSIX there are numerous other options such as fish shell and other newer competitors to bash and zsh. My recommendation is to use the shell that works for you and lets you do what you need to do in the most efficient way possible.</p><p>Ubuntu tries to keep its install wizards small so it does not install zsh by default (OSX on the other hand does I'm fairly sure), so if you want to follow the rest of this tutorial then you'll want to install zsh with the following command:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>$ sudo apt-get install zsh
</code></pre></div><p>When the shell is installed then you need to tell Ubuntu that this is the shell you are interested in installing. You do this with two commands. The first command finds where the zsh binary is and the second tells Ubuntu to change your shell. You copy the output from the first command (<code>ctrl+shift+c</code> when you're in terminal) and paste it into the second command (<code>ctrl+shift+v</code> when you're in terminal).</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>$ which zsh
$ chsh -s $OUTPUT $USER
</code></pre></div><p>In the above command $OUTPUT is the output you get from the first command and $USER is your user name on ubuntu. After that you are all set. What I do generally at this point is to close the terminal window (in Guake this is <code>ctrl+shift+w</code> but that may be what I've set up to follow Chrome rather than the standard) and then open a new terminal window. Voila, you are all set up with zsh.</p><h2 id=making-your-shell-your-shell>Making Your Shell YOUR Shell</h2><p>Now we have all the basics setup with three simple commands in the terminal. You can easily put these into your install script to automate this process whenever you install or reinstall Linux on your machine. The next step is to make the shell YOUR shell by personalizing it.</p><p>The main file you will use to personalize the shell is your <code>~/.zshrc</code>. This is the file that zsh will automatically load by default everytime a new instance of zsh is opened. You can use this file in turn to tell zsh to load other files as we will see. The reason why I like zsh is that there are a lot of plugin which you can use to make the shell your own in a very simple way. A while ago a framework for zsh was developed called <a href=https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh>oh-my-zsh</a> which kicked off the frameworks in zsh in a big way. After a while this became complicated so another team developed a system which automated how this all works.</p><p>I use both of these systems. I use the automated install and updating system to install, remove, and update my zsh files and I use oh-my-zsh as the underlying framework (which I modify) to do much of the heavy lifting. If you want to follow along it will not be very painful I promise. The automatic installation and updater I use is called <a href=https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen>antigen</a>. Here is how you set it up.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen.git $LOCATION
</code></pre></div><p>When you run the git clone command it will pull down antigen but you will want to put it in whatever location you like. I do not recommend putting it in <code>~/.antigen</code> because when you run the script it is going to put a bunch of other files in that location and this could cause conflicts. I put it in my <code>~/coding/antigen</code> folder for instance. Now, when that finished you need to edit your .zshrc file in your favorite text editor. Here's what my file looks like.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#75715e>#!/usr/bin/env zsh

</code></pre></div><p>You can read more about how to use antigen bundles on their github page linked to above, but I'll walk through it. The first thing that the file does is it <code>sources</code> (which in shell means load and use) the main antigen shell script. So point this to wherever you cloned their repo to. The next line tells antigen to use the oh-my-zsh framework (there are others which you could use and the github page shows how to do that). Then there is a long list of the bundles that I want to use. Bundles are simply plugins. At the end you will see a couple of non oh-my-zsh bundles sourced. Antigen knows that when you put a bundle that looks like <code>user/plugin</code> to get it from the github repo. Of course, you can not use the github defaults and you can easily point it to other bundles that you may have on a private git repo.</p><p>After the bundles are loaded then the file tells antigen to use a specific theme. The last thing the file does is to tell zsh to load a bunch of custom files which I keep in my dropbox. That's it. The way that zsh works is that when you pass it one command and then pass it a second command that conflicts with the first then the second one always wins. This is why I source my own custom files after the framework files. This allows me to override small things that the framework does which I do not like.</p><p>You can look on oh-my-zsh page for a lot of different themes. Here's the theme I use.</p><p>My theme tells me my username, hostname, current working directory and then tells me which rvm I'm using and how my git repo is looking (the git repo turns red if it is &lsquo;dirty&rsquo; or green if it is not as you can see from the different repos).

It is not terribly interesting but it makes things easier for me to remember because the oh-my-zsh git bundle kept changing for a while and I think of things slightly differently than they do so I just override a lot of their defaults which is fine.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#75715e># Aliases</span>

</code></pre></div><p>That file I've assembled over the years and to be honest I use maybe 60% of the aliases and functions in it, but the good thing is that when I'm trying to remember how to do something I just pull up that file and it is likely in there. It is probably overkill but it can be useful from time to time.</p><p>Next I source my custom functions files. This is a fun one that allows me to do a bit of coding in zsh and put these into my shell for easy use in the future. I use a lot fo these functions quite frequently.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#75715e>## Process/System functions</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Some highlights of this file include an installation script which allows me to both install a package from apt-get and also to lot that in my install script so that I can then remember to reinstall it on a new system. I also have a collateral package for installing new ppas on my computer. I have built a bunch of network functions that I use every once in a while to figure out what the heck is happening. I also have built a f-u-nsa script which I run when I get to a new country. By changing my mac address and clearing all my cookies I think I can slightly reduce my chances of being flagged within NSA's systems &ndash; this is important when you run a law firm and spend lots of time in the Horn of Africa. Also I have some functions that make working with files and modifying files easier as well as a few specific functions for assisting with different programs like npm (node package manager and cabal which is haskell's package manager and I use to keep on the bleeding edge of pandoc).</p><p>Lastly my <code>.zshrc</code> file sources my aliases which are below and not terribly interesting.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#75715e>#!/usr/bin/env zsh

</code></pre></div><p>One thing which should be mentioned is the difference between functions and aliases. There is a subtle difference between the two. Basically an alias is like a contraction. It is just a shorthand thing for a specific other command. So there is not much you can do with it AFTER the alias. If you need to pass the function a variable (like a file or a folder or a switch) then you should use a function. If you do not need to pass a variable of any time then you can use aliases if you are not trying to do something terribly complex. If there are a lot of steps to what you are trying to accomplish then a function is usually the better way to go even if it does not require any variables. Those are my two cents, am sure others may feel differently.</p><p>And that is it. Type a few commands, copy and paste some files and you'll be good to go with a dynamic, fast, and totally beautiful and useable shell at the push of a button.</p><p>Happy Hacking!</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/tags/linux>linux</a></span><span class=tag><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/tags/shell>shell</a></span></p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/1c665bae0623eb29aad4055082dca65d528f0f87 target=_blank rel=noopener>1c665ba</a> @ 2020-04-10</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2020</span>
