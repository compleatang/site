My name is Casey. I like to do things.

In my life, I've had a few twists and turns to get where I find myself today. I've been a structural engineer, an infantry officer in the Marine Corps, a ski bum, a writer, a lawyer, an international development practitioner, and in legal technology software. Each of these phases of my adult life has contributed in its own distinct manner to how I view the world.
